							About me (non-mathematical)
						</h2>
						<img class="foto-do-rio" src="imagens/aterro-do-flamengo.jpg" alt="A waterfront in Rio de Janeiro">
						<p>
							I moved to Rio de Janeiro in March 2022 to study at IMPA. Since then, I've been adapting to the <em>carioca</em> lifestyle and liberating myself from the frenzy that is natural to anyone from São Paulo (as much as I love that city). I really enjoy being able to go to the beach when I have a few hours to spare, just to look at the sea and relax a bit &mdash; for free!
						</p>
						<p>
							I also got a new hobbie here, which is dancing <em>forró</em>! This is a very fun Brazilian dance that, in my opinion, everyone should try. The weekly forró classes help to relieve the stress from my Master's, because I get so concentrated on following my partner's lead that I have no room to think about anything else. Knowing this dance has also made parties a lot more fun.
						</p>
						<p>
						Aside from these recent habits, I have some older hobbies too. Drawing has always been my favorite, though I haven't had a lot of time for it lately. For now, I content myself with consumming other people's drawings by reading manga and digital comics.
						</p>
						<p>
						Once upon a time, I used to play softball. I hope to get back to it some day.
						</p>
						<h2>
							About my name
						</h2>
						<p>
							I am a Japanese descendant from Brazil. <em>Adriana</em> and <em>Mayumi</em> are given names, and <em>Shiguihara</em> is my family name. The <em>gui</em> is pronounced as the <em>gee</em> in <em>geek</em> (not as <em>gu</em> &plus; <em>i</em>). It is written in this way (with an <em>u</em>) because that is how we write this sound in Portuguese. The other syllables are pronounced as expected from a Japanese word.
